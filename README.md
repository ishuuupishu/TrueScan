 # TrueScan

 **TrueScan** is a machine learning project to identify unreliable or misleading news articles. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project classifies news articles as either "Real" or "Fake" to combat the growing challenge of misinformation.

 ## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing
- **spaCy**: For lemmatization and named entity recognition
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

 ## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified news articles
- **Precision**: Percentage of true positives among all positive predictions
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

 ## Acknowledgments

- **Dataset**: Kaggle Fake News Dataset
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
